# Tableau-Playstore-Data-Analysis

## Overview
This project is centered around two pivotal aspects: Data Preprocessing and Visualization. It aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of Play Store data, focusing on app engagement, user sentiment, and revenue generation.

## Data Preprocessing
In this phase, Python was used to perform several critical tasks to ensure the integrity of the data:

- **Removing Duplicates:** Cleansing the data for accurate analysis.
- **Handling Missing or Null Values:** Employing imputation techniques to fill gaps in the dataset.
- **Eliminating Unnecessary Columns:** Streamlining the dataset for relevancy.
- **Data Type Conversions:** Adjusting data types for consistency and compatibility.
- **Handling Outliers:** Ensuring that data anomalies do not skew the analysis.

This meticulous preprocessing was vital for preparing the data for detailed examination.

## Visualization with Tableau
The cleansed data was then brought to life through interactive dashboards in Tableau, serving the following purposes:

- **Calculated Fields:** Deriving new insights from existing data.
- **Filters:** Enabling exploration of specific data segments.
- **Parameters:** Facilitating dynamic data interactions.
- **Action Filters:** Enhancing user engagement with responsive elements.

### Dashboards Created
1. **App Engagement Dashboard:** Offers insights into user interactions and app popularity.
2. **Sentiment Analysis Dashboard:** Explores user sentiments and opinions about the apps.
3. **Revenue Dashboard:** Highlights the financial performance and revenue trends of apps.

## Tableau Story
The culmination of this project is a cohesive Tableau story that combines all three dashboards. This integration provides a seamless and user-friendly experience, allowing users to navigate effortlessly between different data perspectives â€“ engagement, sentiment, and revenue.
